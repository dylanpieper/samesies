\title{Abstract parent class for similarity comparison}
\usage{

  scores = list(),
  summary = list(),
  methods = character(0),
  list_names = character(0)
)
}
\description{
\code{similar} is an S7 abstract parent class for all similarity comparison objects.
This class defines common properties and validation logic shared among child classes
like \code{similar_text}, \code{similar_factor}, and \code{similar_number}.
}
\details{
This class provides the foundation for all similarity comparison classes.
It includes common properties:
\itemize{
\item scores: List of similarity scores per method and comparison
\item summary: Summary statistics by method and comparison
\item methods: Character vector of methods used for comparison
\item list_names: Character vector of names for the compared lists
}

It also implements common validation logic for ensuring scores are numeric
and fall within the valid range of 0 to 1.

Child classes should inherit from this class and implement their own
specific validation logic for allowed methods and any additional properties.
