\arguments{
\item{...}{Lists of character strings to compare.}

\item{method}{Character vector of similarity methods from \code{stringdist}
(default: c("osa", "lv", "dl", "hamming", "lcs", "qgram", "cosine", "jaccard", "jw", "soundex")).}

\item{q}{Size of q-gram for "qgram", "cosine", and "jaccard" methods (default: 1).}

\item{p}{Winkler scaling factor for "jw" method (default: 0.1).}

\item{bt}{Booth matching threshold for "jw" method (default: 0).}

\item{weight}{Vector of weights for operations: deletion (d), insertion (i),
substitution (s), transposition (t) for "osa", "lv", and "dl" methods.}

\item{digits}{Number of digits to round results (default: 3).}
}
\value{
An S3 class object of type "similar_text" containing:
\itemize{
\item scores: Numeric similarity scores by method and comparison
\item summary: Summary statistics by method and comparison
\item methods: Methods used for comparison
\item list_names: Names of compared lists
}
}
\description{
Computes similarity scores between two or more lists of character strings.
Implements multiple string distance algorithms including edit-based methods (OSA, Levenshtein,
Damerau-Levenshtein, Hamming), sequence-based approaches (LCS), q-gram techniques (qgram, cosine,
jaccard), phonetic matching (soundex), and hybrid methods (Jaro-Winkler).
