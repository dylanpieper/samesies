## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. I addressed the reviewer's feedback by taking the following actions:

* Added \value tags to all exported methods in the roxygen documentation:
  - similar_factor.Rd
  - similar_number.Rd  
  - similar_text.Rd
  - similar.Rd
  - print.summary.similar.Rd
  
  Each function now has proper documentation explaining the return value structure,
  class information, and meaning of the output.

## R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This is a new release.
